Task 1: Message Storage and Retrieval
Research and Analysis:

Message Ordering: Ensuring messages are ordered by timestamp is crucial for a coherent conversation flow.

Search Complexity: Efficient search capabilities are needed to quickly retrieve specific messages.

Storage Overhead: Minimizing storage overhead is important for performance and scalability.

Evaluated Data Structures:

Arrays:

Pros: Fast access with an index, simple to implement.

Cons: Inefficient for insertions/deletions in the middle, not ideal for dynamic data.

Linked Lists:

Pros: Dynamic size, efficient insertions/deletions.

Cons: Slow access times, higher memory usage due to pointers.

Hash Tables:

Pros: Fast lookups, insertions, and deletions.

Cons: High memory overhead, unordered data.

Trees ( AVL Trees, Red-Black Trees):

Pros: Balanced structure ensures O(log n) operations.

Cons: More complex to implement, moderate storage overhead.

Recommended Approach:

Use AVL Trees or Red-Black Trees to store messages ensuring efficient ordered retrieval and dynamic updates.

Task 2: Real-Time Updates
Real-Time Communication Techniques:

Polling:

Pros: Simple to implement.

Cons: Inefficient, high latency, high resource consumption.

Long-Polling:

Pros: Better than polling, reduces unnecessary requests.

Cons: Still not optimal for real-time needs, higher latency.

Websockets:

Pros: Full-duplex communication, low latency, efficient for real-time updates.

Cons: More complex to implement, requires persistent connection.

Recommended Approach:

Implement Websockets for real-time updates ensuring minimal latency and resource consumption.

Task 3: Conversation List Management
Evaluated Data Structures:

Arrays and Linked Lists:

Pros: Simple and straightforward.

Cons: Inefficient for large data sets, slow search operations.

Hash Tables:

Pros: Fast access and retrieval using unique keys.

Cons: Unordered data, high memory usage.

Trees:

Pros: Efficient for sorting, filtering, and indexing.

Cons: Moderate complexity, balanced structure required.

Recommended Approach:

Use Hash Tables for quick access to conversation metadata, complemented by Balanced Trees for sorting, filtering, and indexing conversations.
